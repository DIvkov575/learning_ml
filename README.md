each file in the ./old/ is a new/different experiment I conducted in an attempt to learn machine learning / ds.
to run a file

1) install jupyternotebook (pipx install jupyterlab)
   
3) open file in jupyterlab (jupyter lab)

3a) execute file ...

3b) "jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook <notebook>"

you can run a.py and the converted jupyternotebook (created in 3b) w/ python3 <file_name>
